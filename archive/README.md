# Archive SDG-services-model
This is the archive of the Single Digital Gateway services model. It contains two pre-releases of the SDG services model (v0.01 and v0.02), created in 2019-2020. There are still open issues on this repository belonging to these pre-releases. 
  
## Folder available:
 * **Pre-releases folder**: This folder contains two versions of the SDG services model: v0.01 and v0.02, containing technical specifications, classification analysis, examples, etc.)
 * **Workshop exercise folder**: Exercises held during the workshop on the SDG services model in February 2020
     

## Detailed description:
In 2019-2020 we have created a model for the SDGR, starting from all the information available and creating an elaborate data model. All the issues that are still open in the repository refer to the work on the data model classified to the archive, but can serve as reference for the latest modelling activities. 


The main document of the pre-releases is the SDG Services Model Specification, which provides an in-detail overview of the different classes and properties, including the reason why an element is part of the Extended model or the Core model. (All Core elements are part of the Extended model as well). This document contains:
* An introduction
* The distinction between Extended and Core
* The classes and properties of the model
* An explanation on the recommended vocabularies
* An example of the mapping of a public service


Other documents available in v0.01 (not in v0.02):
* The SDGR Concept analysis, an Excel sheet where the concepts from the SDGR are mapped to existing data models.
* The SDG Classifications, an in-detail overview of the different classifications proposed for the SDG services model, including the explanation why the classification is included in the model.
