# SDG-search-service-model
This is the repository for defining the Single Digital Gateway Search Service model. The latest release of the model is [v1.00](https://github.com/catalogue-of-services-isa/SDG-search-service-model/tree/master/releases/v1.00).
  
## All relevant documents are available:
 * [The releases](https://github.com/catalogue-of-services-isa/SDG-search-service-model/tree/master/releases) of the model.
 * [Codelists](https://github.com/catalogue-of-services-isa/SDG-search-service-model/tree/master/codelists) that are used by the model.
 * [Webinars](https://github.com/catalogue-of-services-isa/SDG-search-service-model/tree/master/webinars): Reports and presentations of the webinars in 2021 for creating the model. 
 * [The analysis](https://github.com/catalogue-of-services-isa/SDG-services-model/tree/master/SDG%20concepts) to create a first list of concepts from the SDGR that served as the basis for the model. 
 * [Archive](https://github.com/catalogue-of-services-isa/SDG-services-model/tree/master/archive): Modelling activities from 2019-2020, including technical specifications, classifications and visualised models.
 * [Scoping document](https://github.com/catalogue-of-services-isa/SDG-search-service-model/blob/master/Scoping%20SDG%20Services%20model.pdf): Scoping document explaining the problem statement, objectives and approach of the model.

## Detailed description:
The information requirements from the SDGR are modelled by identifying concepts that could be harmonized to improve the findability, understandability and quality requirements related to information on rights, obligations and rules, on procedures and on assistance and problem-solving services (articles 9, 10 and 11 to the Regulation)

Therefore, an initial [list of concepts](https://github.com/catalogue-of-services-isa/SDG-services-model/tree/master/SDG%20concepts) from the SDGR is created, with the focus on concepts from articles 9,10 and 11. In this list, you will see each concept with an explanation, references to the regulation, priority proposal in terms of being part of a common data model and a few questions. Note that, in most cases, the names of the concepts are directly coming from the Regulation and are not definitive.

Through this exercise, we are deriving in a pragmatic way with you the most important important information to be captured within the model. The implementation of this data model needs to be agreed and could be applied in a phased approach, starting with pilots.

## Archive
In the past year, we have created a data model for the SDGR in a different approach, starting from all the information available in the regulation and creating an elaborate data model. This work can be used as a referral and guidance for the current exercise, which starts from concrete use cases: the findability, understandability and quality of the information from the SDGR, and in particular from articles 9 to 11.  All the issues that are still open in the repository refer to the work on the data model classified to the archive, but can serve as reference for the latest modelling activities. 

In the [archive](https://github.com/catalogue-of-services-isa/SDG-services-model/tree/master/archive) we have gathered all the information from previous data modelling exercises (two versions v0.01 and v0.02 have been created):
* Draft model as a visual diagram
* Technical specifications of the draft model
* An SDGR analysis for creating this draft model
* Classification propositions
* Business cases
* Examples
