## Detailed description:
To provide detailed guidelines on how this model should be read and what we understand for all classes, properties and relationships, we have attached multiple documents to this communication. Depending on your area of expertise you can read the documents relevant for you.

Firstly, we have added an image of the Extended and one of the Core SDG Data Model. All elements that can be found in the Core model are also present in the Extended model.
The main document is the SDG Data Model Specification, which provides an in-detail overview of the different classes and properties, including the reason why an element is part of the Extended model or the Core model. (All Core elements are part of the Extended model as well). This document contains:
* An introduction
* The distinction between Extended and Core
* The classes and properties of the model
* An explanation on the recommended vocabularies
* An example of the mapping of a public service

Other documents in attachment:
* The SDGR Concept analysis, an Excel sheet were the concepts from the SDGR are mapped to existing data models.
* The SDG Classifications, an in-detail overview of the different classifications proposed for the SDG Data model, including the explanation why the classification is included in the model.
